# kobotoolbox.org

A simple static website for KoBoToolbox.

## Development setup

Start off with `npm install` and (optionally) `gem install jekyll`.

- building styles once: `npm run styles-build`
- building styles with watch: `npm run styles-watch`
- building the website: `npm run jekyll-build`
- serving development website: `npm run jekyll-serve` plus go to localhost:2038

If you want to add blog posts, just create a new one at `_posts` directory. You don't need to build anything, as GitHub does it automagically.
