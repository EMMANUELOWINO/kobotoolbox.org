#### About the Organization

Physicians for Human Rights (PHR) works at the intersection of medicine, science, and law to secure justice and universal human rights for all.

#### Project Description

Since the beginning of the conflict in Syria, the ongoing assault on health care facilities and personnel has been a defining factor. As a strategy of war, it is effective. It is also illegal. PHR has systematically documented these war crimes since the start of the Syrian conflict in 2011. In addition to documenting and mapping the attacks in real time, the intent of the project is to also create a post-conflict database for justice and accountability. 

Over the lifespan of the project, and through a rigorous verification and corroboration process, PHR has documented almost 1,400 individual attacks made by at least 5 different attacking groups. The entire data entry process has been conducted remotely in New York by a team who work with a mixture of online and field sources.

#### KoBoToolbox's Role

PHR began using KoBoToolbox as its primary data collection tool for this project in 2018, and within a year of being implemented, KoBoToolbox has already proven to greatly simplify PHR's existing data collection and reporting workflow. Before making the switch, PHR's data was divided into at least 10 different datasets, due to various people over the years working on the project and collecting data in different ways and formats.

With help from someone on the KoBo team, PHR migrated and integrated all of their existing data into one unified dataset. Having only one dataset has made it much easier for the team to reference and review all of their data, which has also naturally cleaned and standardized the data in the process. 

Going forward all new data entries are being collected and added to the unified dataset using KoBoToolbox. This not only has greatly simplified the work flow, data management, onboarding, and other aspects of the project, it has provided PHR with an easy framework and user interface to input complex and multi-layered data points.
