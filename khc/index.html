The purpose of this document is to establish
                    the scope, purpose and structure of the KoBoToolbox Humanitarian Committee (KHC).</p>
                <p>The KHC will inform the development of KoBoToolbox for humanitarian use, including overall strategy and vision on technological issues, community development, integration and fundraising to ensure the long-term sustainability of the tools

                <h4>KoBoToolbox</h4>
                <p>KoBoToolbox was founded in 2005 by Phuong Pham and Patrick Vinck. They joined the Harvard Humanitarian Initiative (HHI) in 2011 and Brigham and Women’s Hospital in 2012, where they now maintain KoBoToolbox as an open-source project. It
                    includes software engineers, designers, user support agents, and other specialists in several countries, most of whom have deep personal experience with field data collection in humanitarian crises and other challenging environments.
                    </p>
                <p>With funding from USAID, UNOCHA and IRC partnered with KoBoToolbox to take the existing tool and transform it into a comprehensive platform for humanitarian data collection. The resulting platform was launched in 2014 as a free tool with
                    unlimited data collection and storage for humanitarian actors (kobo.humanitarianresponse.info).</p>
                <p>As a lead partner, UNOCHA has worked closely in partnership with HHI to promote the platform to humanitarian users, offering it as a potential solution to harmonized needs assessments and promoting an evidence-based approach to humanitarian
                    programming. OCHA has also channeled funding towards the project and allocated dedicated internal resources to manage the project for the humanitarian community. These funds have been used primarily to continuously develop features
                    based on user feedback, continue free remote user support, establish a training platform (<a href="https://www.training.kobotoolbox.org">training.kobotoolbox.org</a>) and to sustain the public KoBoToolbox server for humanitarians.</p>
                <p>KoBoToolbox is also supported through grants and contracts from private foundations, philanthropists, United Nations agencies, and non-governmental organizations.</p>
                <p>The KoBoToolbox team which is responsible for the maintenance and development of KoBoToolbox is composed of researchers and programmers affiliated with the Harvard Humanitarian Initiative, the Brigham and Women’s Hospital, and Kweyo LL.</p>
                <h4>Vision and Values</h4>
                <p>KoBoToolbox for use in humanitarian emergencies aims to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <p>1. Enable high-quality humanitarian decision making and coordination through rapid and reliable primary data collection and analysis.</p>
                    <p>2. Reduce fragmentation during data collection by providing the tools to establish common standards, usage of metadata, allowing for confidential sharing of data, and </p>
                    <p>3. Increase the number of surveys and assessments done with high quality electronic tools by providing a tool that is simple enough for non-technically skilled persons while also being adaptable to local requirements.</p>
                </ul>
                <p>To achieve this, KoBoToolbox was developed with the following core values, which the proposed bodies aim to protect:</p>
                <ul>
                    <p>1. A platform developed and governed for humanitarians by humanitarians for the benefit of the wider humanitarian community and not just for a specific agency or organization.</p>
                    <p>2. A platform that is free, open source, and fully accessible for all humanitarian users including basic support, ensuring that even the smallest local NGOs have access to quality tools and services.</p>
                    <p>3. Use open form-building and data collection standards to ensure compatibility with other tools and guarantee the flexibility to customize the platform if necessary, while minimizing fragmentation of tools, and building transferable
                        skills and mutual support.</p>
                    <p>4. Enable the reliable collection, management, and sharing of data to enhance the quality of humanitarian programming and promote evidence-based and harmonized approaches within the humanitarian community.</p>
                </ul>

                <p style="font-size: 10pt">* Tier 4 is for organizations who already contribute earmarked funding to KoBoToolbox and include at least $7,500 un-earmarked funds as part of that support.</p>
                <p>Membership will be paid to any of the KoBoToolbox technical team affiliated institutions. </p>
                <h4>Benefits of being a member</h4>
                <p>Membership in the KoBoToolbox Humanitarian Committee provides several benefits:</p>
                <ul>
                    <p>1. Decision making: Members will have significant influence and a direct vote to decide on which new features and improvements should be developed by the KoBoToolbox technical team, based on available resources (see 2.4.).</p>
                    <p>2. Each member will receive priority basic user support by KoBoToolbox professional staff, as described in Annex I. Each member will be entitled to user support up to the number of hours of its membership tier, as listed above. The
                        support will be provided by dedicated support agents for any technical issues related to the use of KoBoToolbox, such as form creation, data access questions, general usability queries, linking to other tools, etc.</p>
                    <p>3. Additional paid user support options will be available to members, including advanced user support such as support for deployments, systems administration, and similar issues provided directly by relevant developers and/or System
                        Administrators at KoBoToolbox.</p>
                    <p>4. Visibility: through their support, members will demonstrate their commitment and support to open-source solutions that benefit the entire community of humanitarian actors, including numerous local and community-based organizations
                        who would not otherwise have access to similar tools and support. Members will be recognized on the highly visited KoboToolbox website and in publications</p>
                    <p>5. Coordination: The network will leverage all of the members contribution to achieve major advancement that would not be otherwise be funded by single contributions. This coordinated approach ensures that KoBoToolbox is firmly developed
                        by all humanitarians and for all humanitarians. </p>
                </ul>
                <h4>Financial Model of the KHC</h4>
                <p>Membership fees will cover three elements in a sequential manner, depending on the availability of funds. The maintenance costs and user support costs will be supported by additional external funding.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <b>
              <p>1. Maintenance of the KoBoToolbox software and service
            </b> (security updates, bug fixes, operating costs like server…): A portion of each member’s fees will cover this fixed expenditure of software engineers maintaining the stability of both the software and the public platform
                    for the benefit of both the members and the wider community, as well as general running costs such as the support platform and server costs. This part of the expenditure will also be covered by other non-earmarked funding raised through
                    different channels (with members’ help wherever possible).</p>
                    <b>
              <p>2. Priority user support 
            </b> benefiting individuals within the member’s organization: This covers support agents as well as the user support platform. The financial proportion allocated for this part is variable, meaning that as more members join
                    the KHC, more user agents will be added to the team. This part is directly covered by each member’s fees.</p>
                    <b>
              <p>3. Feature development and general improvements: 
            </b> Once fixed costs within (1) and (2) are covered, all remaining funds are allocated by the KHC towards platform improvements and/or new feature developments to be implemented by the KoBoToolbox technical team under
                    the direction of the KHC. This will follow the following procedure:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <p>a. A KHC member proposes changes (i.e. new features or software improvements), including exact specifications, user stories, and other relevant details.
                        </p>
                        <p>b. If a second member seconds the proposed changes, the KoBoToolbox team will work with the member(s) to refine exact specifications. The KoBoToolbox team will then assess changes requested in terms of 1) the technical feasibility,
                            and 2) the costs for implementing the changes.
                        </p>
                        <p>c. This cost and feasibility assessment will be provided back to the KHC for each proposed feature, including if a proposed feature is not technically feasible or in conflict with the values outlined in section 1 above.
                        </p>
                        <p>d. Based on these assessments, members will vote at a KHC meeting to decide on which of those changes should be implemented and in what priority (assuming sufficient funds are available and the KoBoToolbox team has deemed technically
                            feasible).
                        </p>
                        <p>e. Exact implementation details (such as staffing, selection of software libraries, etc.) will be at the sole discretion of the KoBoToolbox team.
                        </p>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
                <h4>Annex I: User support terms</h4>
                <p>The following section specifies how priority user support will be provided to KHC member organizations and their respective users. Dependent on a sufficient number of members, more user support agents will be hired to eventually provide
                    coverage of all major time zones as well as on weekends. Time spent on user support will be tracked transparently for each member. </p>
                <ul>
                    <p><b>1. Inclusion: </b>Users will be included in a KHC member’s priority support inbox based on official email address domains as well as or in addition to manual lists provided to KoBoToolbox by each KHC member for additional users
                        (e.g. consultants who do not own a relevant email address belonging to that organization). </p>
                    <p><b>2. Response: </b>Users will be included in a KHC member’s priority support inbox based on official email address domains as well as or in addition to manual lists provided to KoBoToolbox by each KHC member for additional users (e.g.
                        consultants who do not own a relevant email address belonging to that organization). </p>
                    <p><b>3. Support content coverage </b>Users will be included in a KHC member’s priority support inbox based on official email address domains as well as or in addition to manual lists provided to KoBoToolbox by each KHC member for additional
                        users (e.g. consultants who do not own a relevant email address belonging to that organization). </p>
                    <p><b>4. Tracking/reporting: </b>Users will be included in a KHC member’s priority support inbox based on official email address domains as well as or in addition to manual lists provided to KoBoToolbox by each KHC member for additional
                        users (e.g. consultants who do not own a relevant email address belonging to that organization).</p>
                    <p><b>5. Bug prioritization: </b>Technical issues with KoBoToolbox software (bugs) will be added to GitHub and classified according to four levels and fixed in order of priority, as described below:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Critical: Any issue that significantly impairs a major feature for all users will be fixed immediately (usually a result of a bad deploy), such as inability to deploy, download data, etc.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            High priority: Any issue that impairs a major feature for some users, representing a regression based on previous deployments, will be marked as 'high priority'. Such bugs are fixed within one week.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Member priority bugs: Any issue that does not fit the above criteria but that a member requests to be done sooner will be fixed within 2 weeks
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Any other bug will enter the backlog and fixed based on available time.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
