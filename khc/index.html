        <h2>Vision and Values</h2>

        <p>KoBoToolbox for use in humanitarian emergencies aims to:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Enable high-quality humanitarian decision making and coordination through rapid and reliable primary data collection and analysis.</li>

    <div class="container">
        <h2>Membership Details</h2>

        <p>The KoBoToolbox Humanitarian Committee shall consist of one representative from each member organization. Invited members may be selected based on unique non-financial contribution equivalent to membership fees at the discretion of the KoBoToolbox technical team.</p>

        <p><strong>Term:</strong> A term of membership shall last for one year based on membership fee. Terms shall be renewable annually with a grace period of 30 days. Terms will begin on September 1st or on the date that the membership fee is received at the request of the contributor.</p>

        <p><strong>Officers:</strong> The Committee will have a chair and vice chair appointed every two years. KoBoToolbox will provide a secretary for record purposes.</p>

        <p><strong>Meetings:</strong> The KoBoToolbox Humanitarian Committee will meet at least twice a year. The sessions will be held primarily remotely due to the wide geographic diversity of members, supported by a relevant platform (e.g. WebEx). Written notices of upcoming meetings will be e-mailed to members at least ten days before a meeting. Minutes will be taken by KoBoToolbox and made available to all participants after each meeting. Additional meetings will be held at the request of at least 3 members. The quorum for the meetings must include at least a half (50%) of members, as well as a KoBoToolbox representative.

        <h3>Benefits of being a member</h3>

        <p>Membership in the KoBoToolbox Humanitarian Committee provides several benefits:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Decision making: Members will have significant influence and a direct vote to decide on which new features and improvements should be developed by the KoBoToolbox technical team, based on available resources (see 2.4.).</li>
            <li>Each member will receive priority basic user support by KoBoToolbox professional staff, as described in Annex I. Each member will be entitled to user support up to the number of hours of its membership tier, as listed above. The support will be provided by dedicated support agents for any technical issues related to the use of KoBoToolbox, such as form creation, data access questions, general usability queries, linking to other tools, etc.</li>
            <li>Additional paid user support options will be available to members, including advanced user support such as support for deployments, systems administration, and similar issues provided directly by relevant developers and/or System Administrators at KoBoToolbox.</li>
            <li>Visibility: through their support, members will demonstrate their commitment and support to open-source solutions that benefit the entire community of humanitarian actors, including numerous local and community-based organizations who would not otherwise have access to similar tools and support. Members will be recognized on the highly visited KoboToolbox website and in publications</li>
            <li>Coordination: The network will leverage all of the members contribution to achieve major advancement that would not be otherwise be funded by single contributions. This coordinated approach ensures that KoBoToolbox is firmly developed by all humanitarians and for all humanitarians.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Financial Model of the KHC</h3>

        <p>Membership fees will cover three elements in a sequential manner, depending on the availability of funds. The maintenance costs and user support costs will be supported by additional external funding.</p>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Maintenance of the KoBoToolbox software and service</strong> (security updates, bug fixes, operating costs like server…): A portion of each member’s fees will cover this fixed expenditure of software engineers maintaining the stability of both the software and the public platform for the benefit of both the members and the wider community, as well as general running costs such as the support platform and server costs. This part of the expenditure will also be covered by other non-earmarked funding raised through different channels (with members’ help wherever possible).</li>
            <li><strong>Priority user support</strong> benefiting individuals within the member’s organization: This covers support agents as well as the user support platform. The financial proportion allocated for this part is variable, meaning that as more members join the KHC, more user agents will be added to the team. This part is directly covered by each member’s fees.</li>
            <li><strong>Feature development and general improvements:</strong> Once fixed costs within (1) and (2) are covered, all remaining funds are allocated by the KHC towards platform improvements and/or new feature developments to be implemented by the KoBoToolbox technical team under the direction of the KHC. This will follow the following procedure:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>a. A KHC member proposes changes (i.e. new features or software improvements), including exact specifications, user stories, and other relevant details.</li>
                <li>b. If a second member seconds the proposed changes, the KoBoToolbox team will work with the member(s) to refine exact specifications. The KoBoToolbox team will then assess changes requested in terms of 1) the technical feasibility, and 2) the costs for implementing the changes.</li>
                <li>c. This cost and feasibility assessment will be provided back to the KHC for each proposed feature, including if a proposed feature is not technically feasible or in conflict with the values outlined in section 1 above.</li>
                <li>d. Based on these assessments, members will vote at a KHC meeting to decide on which of those changes should be implemented and in what priority (assuming sufficient funds are available and the KoBoToolbox team has deemed technically feasible).</li>
                <li>e. Exact implementation details (such as staffing, selection of software libraries, etc.) will be at the sole discretion of the KoBoToolbox team.</li>
            </ul>
        </ol>

        <h3>Annex I: User support terms</h3>

        <p>The following section specifies how priority user support will be provided to KHC member organizations and their respective users. Dependent on a sufficient number of members, more user support agents will be hired to eventually provide coverage of all major time zones as well as on weekends. Time spent on user support will be tracked transparently for each member.</p>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Inclusion:</strong> Users will be included in a KHC member’s priority support inbox based on official email address domains as well as or in addition to manual lists provided to KoBoToolbox by each KHC member for additional users (e.g. consultants who do not own a relevant email address belonging to that organization).</li>
            <li><strong>Response:</strong> Users will be included in a KHC member’s priority support inbox based on official email address domains as well as or in addition to manual lists provided to KoBoToolbox by each KHC member for additional users (e.g. consultants who do not own a relevant email address belonging to that organization).</li>
            <li><strong>Support content coverage</strong> Users will be included in a KHC member’s priority support inbox based on official email address domains as well as or in addition to manual lists provided to KoBoToolbox by each KHC member for additional users (e.g. consultants who do not own a relevant email address belonging to that organization).</li>
            <li><strong>Tracking/reporting:</strong> Users will be included in a KHC member’s priority support inbox based on official email address domains as well as or in addition to manual lists provided to KoBoToolbox by each KHC member for additional users (e.g. consultants who do not own a relevant email address belonging to that organization).</li>
            <li>
                <strong>Bug prioritization:</strong> Technical issues with KoBoToolbox software (bugs) will be added to GitHub and classified according to four levels and fixed in order of priority, as described below:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Critical: Any issue that significantly impairs a major feature for all users will be fixed immediately (usually a result of a bad deploy), such as inability to deploy, download data, etc.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        High priority: Any issue that impairs a major feature for some users, representing a regression based on previous deployments, will be marked as 'high priority'. Such bugs are fixed within one week.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Member priority bugs: Any issue that does not fit the above criteria but that a member requests to be done sooner will be fixed within 2 weeks
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Any other bug will enter the backlog and fixed based on available time.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
